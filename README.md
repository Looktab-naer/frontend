LOOKTAB NFT Maker is a site for store owners to make their own NFT Reward Program.
LOOKTAP breaks limitation of offline space to give great user-experience with our mobile DApp. Users can find their local information by strolling around cities with their mobile device and get reward as form of NFTs from store owners.

* Store owners are not used to technical side of NFTs, so we made a NFT Maker which helps store owners to make their own NFT Reward without any technical knowledge.
* Store owners can make their Near wallet in NFT Maker Site and mint NFT Rewards before doing airdrop with it.
* We deployed our own Rust-based NFT smart contract on near, which is from paras's smart contract.

**What is NFT Reward Program?**
We're aiming to help users seamlessly onboard our DApp and concept of web3. NFTs are the most powerful tools to start the journey of Web3 for users like Reddit NFTs did. Moreover, Gamification factors can increase users' engagement with offline stores. Users can use NFTs as a role of reward, including the concept of coupons or badges as proof of membership. Users can check these NFTs with mobile in-app Near Wallet and redeem them quickly. Furthermore, Store owners can make their own NFT Reward Program with our solution. It would be getting used to ordinary people since Starbucks also launched the NFT-based Loyalty Program.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
